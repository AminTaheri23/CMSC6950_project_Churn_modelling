# CMSC6950_project_Churn_modelling

This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer. In this project, with the help of different Machine Learning algorithms, we classify the two classes of the customers.
